# LocalFlow

**Local-first AI workflow automation platform**

Build, run, and automate AI workflows entirely on your local machine - no cloud required.

## What is LocalFlow?

LocalFlow is a **local AI agent framework**. You design workflows visually, connect tools, and let a local AI decide how to use them to complete tasks. It's like giving an AI a toolbox and watching it figure out what to do.

**Everything runs locally.** No API keys. No cloud. No data leaves your machine.

## Key Features

### 🎨 Visual Workflow Builder
Drag & drop nodes, connect them, run workflows with real-time progress.

### 🤖 AI Orchestrator
An autonomous agent that examines available tools, plans a sequence, and executes step-by-step.

### 🔧 11 Built-in Tools
AI tools (name generator, color picker, trait generator, backstory), utility (calculator, datetime, ID generator), file operations, HTTP, shell, and more.

### 🔌 Plugin System
Drop a folder in `~/.localflow/plugins/` → auto-discovered on startup. Create custom tools with simple JavaScript.

### 💬 Master AI Chat
A conversational interface that knows the entire system. Ask it to explain, design, or build workflows.

### 🌐 Full API Access
- **REST API** (port 9998): List templates, run workflows, chat with Master AI
- **WebSocket** (port 9999): Real-time execution streaming
- **MCP Server**: Use LocalFlow from Claude Desktop

### 🧠 Local LLM
Runs Llama 3.2, Qwen, SmolLM models locally via llama.cpp. Download models in-app.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

1. **Load a Model**: Models tab → Download → Load
2. **Pick a Template**: Templates tab → Click to load
3. **Run**: Click the green Run button

## API Examples

```bash
# List available workflows
curl http://localhost:9998/templates

# Run a workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:9998/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"templateId": "ai-character-builder"}'

# Chat with Master AI
curl -X POST http://localhost:9998/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What can you do?"}'
```

## Claude Desktop Integration (MCP)

LocalFlow can be used as a tool from Claude Desktop.

1. Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "localflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/localflow/mcp-server/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Say: "Use localflow to run the character builder"

See [mcp-server/README.md](mcp-server/README.md) for details.
